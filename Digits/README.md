## Principal Component Analysis - Digits tutorial
### Visualization and denoising of handwritten digits

_Goal:_ Review principal component analysis (PCA) and remobilize formulas learned in Python. Apply this technique to a study of a simple data set made up of handwritten numbers.

We could take the study a step further by looking at the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database, which also contains handwritten digits, but in greater detail (dimension $784=28\times28$). In this case, a kernel-PCA decomposition could be used for denoising. This algorithm is outside the scope of this course.

## Non-negative Matrix Factorization: 
### Movie Recommendation: _What movie should I watch this evening?_

The objective of this tutorial is to use in practice Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). More precisely, we will build a movie recommendation system, which is a standard problem where NMF is used.
Here, we apply NMF to user-item matrix, representing the ratings of different persons for different movies. The goal is to make good use of these data to predict the movies that a new user is likely to like.

# Data Analysis

This course is dedicated to learning the _multidimensional exploratory methods_ essential for data preparation, such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, correspondence analysis, multidimensional postioning, non-negative factorization, etc., as well as unsupervised classification (clustering) using k-means, CAH, DBSCAN, Gaussian mixtures.

## Class Project

**Data** - [Velib dataset](velib/data/) <br>

**Launch notebook** - [Lauch notebook in R](velib/) <br>

**Launch notebook** - [Lauch notebook in Python](velib/)

<br>


## PART I: Basic dimension reduction methods

**TP - Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** - [Smartphone signal analysis](HumanActivityRecognition/). <br>
_Goal:_ Use case of human activity recognition from smartphone recordings (gyroscope, accelerometer) to illustrate the main exploration and learning stages common to data science: Exploration and initial modeling using PCA, LDA, logistic regression.

<br>


## PART II: Clustering methods

**TP - Wine** - [Study of different physico-chemical measurements on wine](Wine/). <br>
_Goal:_ To apply the different concepts studied during the course on clustering on _quantitative_ data, using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language.
<br>

**TP - Mars** - [Large multi-spectral image segmentation: Representing the geological diversity of the surface of Mars](Mars/). <br>
_Goal:_ To apply the different concepts studied during the course on clustering on _quantitative_ data, using [Python](https://www.python.org/) language. More precisely, apply clustering to pixels of a multi-spectral image representing the surface of Mars.

<br>


##  PART III: Advanced factorial methods

**TP - Movie Lens** - [What movie should I watch this evening?](MovieLens/) <br>
_Goal:_ To use in practice Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (**NMF**). More precisely, to build a movie recommendation system.
